        <li>1 (2 pound) lobster, split</li>

        <li>7 tablespoons butter, divided</li>

        <li> 1 small onion, diced</li>

        <li> 2 cups milk</li>

        <li> 1 shallot, chopped</li>

        <li> 10 black peppercorns</li>

        <li> 1 clove garlic, minced</li>

        <li> 5 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>

        <li> 1 pound shredded Gruyere cheese</li>

        <li> 3 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>

        <li> 1 cup grated Romano cheese</li>

        <li> kosher salt and pepper to taste</li>

        <li> 3 tablespoons panko bread crumbs</li>



    </ul>
    <h2><strong>STEPS</strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>

            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in boiling water, stirring
            occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Reserve 2 cups hot pasta water, then drain
            macaroni in a colander set in the sink. Rinse with cold water to cool; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>

            Pour reserved pasta water into the same pot and add lobster halves, cut-side up. Bring to a boil, then
            reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and steam until lobster meat firms and turns opaque, about 3 minutes.
            Remove lobster to a tray and cool for a few minutes, then remove meat and cut into bite-sized pieces.
            Reserve shells.
        </li>
        <li>

            Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir onion in hot butter until onion is
            softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove onions to a small bowl; set aside. Place reserved lobster
            shells, milk, shallot, peppercorns, and garlic into the same saucepan. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium
            heat and cook for 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>

            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>

            Melt remaining 5 tablespoons butter in a separate saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour and stir
            until mixture turns pasty and light golden brown, about 10 minutes. Strain milk mixture through a mesh sieve
            and slowly pour into flour mixture while whisking. Bring to a simmer over medium heat; cook and stir until
            thick and smooth, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>

            Stir Gruy√®re, Cheddar, and Romano cheeses into thickened milk mixture until melted and smooth. Season with
            salt and pepper, then stir in reserved lobster meat, onions, and macaroni. Pour mixture into a 4-quart
            casserole dish and smooth the top. Sprinkle evenly with panko crumbs.
        </li>
        <li>

            Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and the top is golden brown, 8 to 12 minutes.
